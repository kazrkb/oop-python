    "An **object** is a real-world thing created from a class. If a class is a blueprint, an object is the actual item built from that blueprint.\n",

    "## Key Points\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "- Each object can have different values for its properties, but shares the structure defined by the class.\n",
    "- Objects can use the functions (methods) defined in the class.\n",

    "- Here, `my_dog` and `your_dog` are objects (instances) of the `Dog` class.\n",

    "# Python Constructor Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "A **constructor** in Python is a special method used to initialize (set up) a new object when it is created from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "- The constructor method in Python is always named `__init__`.\n",
    "- It runs automatically when you create a new object from a class.\n",
    "- It is used to set the initial values of the object's properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, parameters):\n",
    "        # initialization code\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Types of Constructors\n",
    "- **Default Constructor:** No parameters except `self`.\n",
    "- **Parameterized Constructor:** Takes additional arguments to set properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Constructors?\n",
    "- To make sure every object starts with the right data.\n",

    "# Object Attributes vs Class Attributes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python OOP, **attributes** are variables that belong to a class or an object. There are two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Class Attributes\n",
    "- Shared by all objects of the class.\n",
    "- Defined directly inside the class, but outside any methods.\n",
    "- Changing a class attribute affects all objects (unless the object has its own attribute with the same name).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    species = \"Canine\"  # class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # object attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog1.species)  # Output: Canine\n",
    "print(dog2.species)  # Output: Canine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Object Attributes\n",
    "- Unique to each object (instance).\n",
    "- Defined using `self` inside methods (usually in `__init__`).\n",
    "- Changing an object attribute only affects that specific object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "print(dog2.name)  # Output: Max\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences\n",
    "- **Class Attribute:** Shared by all objects (like a label for the whole group).\n",
    "- **Object Attribute:** Unique to each object (like a name tag for each member).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Table\n",
    "| Attribute Type   | Where Defined         | Shared?         |\n",
    "|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| Class Attribute  | In the class         | Yes             |\n",
    "| Object Attribute | In methods with self | No (per object) |\n",

    "## Encapsulation\n",
