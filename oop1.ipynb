    "# Understanding Objects in Python (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "An **object** is a real-world thing created from a class. If a class is a blueprint, an object is the actual item built from that blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "- Each object can have different values for its properties, but shares the structure defined by the class.\n",
    "- Objects can use the functions (methods) defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects from the Dog class\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "your_dog = Dog(\"Max\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dog.name)   # Output: Buddy\n",
    "print(your_dog.name) # Output: Max\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Here, `my_dog` and `your_dog` are objects (instances) of the `Dog` class.\n",
    "- Each object has its own data (`name` and `age`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Objects?\n",
    "- To represent real-world things in code (like a car, student, or dog).\n",
    "- To organize data and functions together.\n",
    "- To make code reusable and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "- Object = Instance of a class\n",
    "- Objects have their own data and can use class methods\n",
    "- You create objects to work with real data in your program"

    "- Think of a class as a recipe, and objects as the cakes you bake from that recipe.\n",
    "- You use the class to create objects (instances) with the same structure but different data.\n",

    "# Python Constructor Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "A **constructor** in Python is a special method used to initialize (set up) a new object when it is created from a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "- The constructor method in Python is always named `__init__`.\n",
    "- It runs automatically when you create a new object from a class.\n",
    "- It is used to set the initial values of the object's properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, parameters):\n",
    "        # initialization code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "s1 = Student(\"Alice\", 20)\n",
    "print(s1.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(s1.age)   # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Constructors\n",
    "- **Default Constructor:** No parameters except `self`.\n",
    "- **Parameterized Constructor:** Takes additional arguments to set properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Constructors?\n",
    "- To make sure every object starts with the right data.\n",
    "- To run any setup code when an object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special Notes\n",
    "- You can only have one `__init__` method per class. If you define it more than once, the last one will be used.\n",
    "- The first parameter of `__init__` is always `self`, which refers to the object being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "- Constructor = `__init__` method\n",
    "- Used for initializing new objects\n",
    "- Runs automatically when you create an object\n",

    "# Object Attributes vs Class Attributes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python OOP, **attributes** are variables that belong to a class or an object. There are two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Class Attributes\n",
    "- Shared by all objects of the class.\n",
    "- Defined directly inside the class, but outside any methods.\n",
    "- Changing a class attribute affects all objects (unless the object has its own attribute with the same name).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    species = \"Canine\"  # class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # object attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog1.species)  # Output: Canine\n",
    "print(dog2.species)  # Output: Canine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Object Attributes\n",
    "- Unique to each object (instance).\n",
    "- Defined using `self` inside methods (usually in `__init__`).\n",
    "- Changing an object attribute only affects that specific object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "print(dog2.name)  # Output: Max\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences\n",
    "- **Class Attribute:** Shared by all objects (like a label for the whole group).\n",
    "- **Object Attribute:** Unique to each object (like a name tag for each member).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Table\n",
    "| Attribute Type   | Where Defined         | Shared?         |\n",
    "|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| Class Attribute  | In the class         | Yes             |\n",
    "| Object Attribute | In methods with self | No (per object) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:**\n",
    "- Use class attributes for things all objects have in common.\n",
    "- Use object attributes for things that are different for each object."
